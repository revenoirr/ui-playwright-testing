# Review

* Write README.md in english language
*  package.json. Move to devDependencies:
*     "@faker-js/faker": "^8.0.2",
*     "@playwright/test": "^1.36.0",
*     "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
*     "playwright": "^1.36.0",
*     "ts-node": "^10.9.1",
*     "typescript": "^5.1.6"

done 
* Is BDD approcah implemented?
* Remove all locators to the Page Objects.
* How to launch with specific key word test in Chrome browser with resolution 1920 x 1080?
* Remove hardcoded waiters 
* Use "domcontentloaded" for pages where you need to start testing immediately after the DOM has loaded.
*  Use "load" for pages where it is important to wait for all resources to load (for example, if the test depends on images or external scripts).
*  Use "networkidle" for pages with dynamic content where you need to wait for all network requests to complete.
*    Playwright automatically waits for elements to become ready for interaction (visible, clickable, etc.) by default. This reduces the need for manual delays.
* 
* waitForSelector()
* Waits for an element to appear, disappear, or change state on the page. You can specify the state: 'visible', 'hidden', 'attached', 'detached'.
* 
* This is the best way to wait for a specific element instead of a fixed delay.
* 
* waitForFunction()
* Allows you to wait for an arbitrary condition specified as a function. Used for more complex checks when you need to wait for a specific state in the DOM or JS.
